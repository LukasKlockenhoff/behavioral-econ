note = {In einer gesellschaftlichen Debatte gibt es immer mehrere Blickwinkel
zu einem politischen Thema, durch die manche Informationen
hervorgehoben und besonders betont werden, während andere als weniger
wichtig erachtet werden. Diese selektiven Sichtweisen werden in der
kommunikationswissenschaftlichen Forschung als „Frames“
bezeichnet. Das Wechselspiel und das Aushandeln von Frames seitens
strategischer Kommunikatoren, Journalisten sowie Rezipienten werden
mit dem Framing-Ansatz untersucht.Dieser Band gibt eine leicht lesbare
Einführung in die theoretischen Grundlagen, methodischen
Vorgehensweisen und empirischen Ergebnisse dieses prominenten Ansatzes
der kommunikationswissenschaftlichen Medieninhalts- und
Medienwirkungsforschung. Er eignet sich als Lehrbuch für Studierende,
als Nachschlagewerk zu den Strömungen und neuesten Erkenntnissen
dieses Forschungsfeldes sowie als Startpunkt für Forschungsarbeiten
zum Themenfeld Framing.},

abstract={Public support for climate policies is important for their efficacy, yet little is known about how different framings of climate change affect public support for climate policies around the world. Here we report findings from a conjoint experiment of 7,500 adults in five countries -- China, Germany, India, UK, and USA -- to identify climate messages that elicit greater support for policies to tackle climate change. Messages were randomly varied on four attributes: positive (opportunity) or negative (threat) framings, theme (health, environment, economy, migration), scale (individual, community, national, global), and time (current, 2030, 2050). We find that a positive frame, health and environmental frames, and global and immediate frames bolster public support. We examine differences between countries, and across groups within countries -- particularly focusing on the effect of these frames among individuals that are unconcerned about climate change. Among this group, positive and health frames increase the likelihood of support for climate policies, indicating the relevance of these frames for shifting policy preferences for different audience groups.},

abstract = {Communicating possible effects of climate change inevitably involves uncertainty. Because people are generally averse to uncertainty, this activity has the potential to undermine effective action more than stimulate it. The present research considered how framing climate change predictions differently might moderate the tendency for uncertainty to undermine individual action. Two studies (Ns=88 and 120) show that higher uncertainty combined with a negative frame (highlighting possible losses) decreased individual intentions to behave environmentally. However when higher uncertainty was combined with a positive frame (highlighting the possibility of losses not materializing) this produced stronger intentions to act. Study 2 revealed that these effects of uncertainty were mediated through feelings of efficacy. These results suggest that uncertainty is not an inevitable barrier to action, provided communicators frame climate change messages in ways that trigger caution in the face of uncertainty.}

abstract={Communication researchers and practitioners have suggested that framing climate change in terms of public health and/or national security may make climate change more personally relevant and emotionally engaging to segments of the public who are currently disengaged or even dismissive of the issue. To evaluate these assumptions, using a nationally representative online survey of U.S. residents (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1,127) conducted in December, 2010, we randomly assigned six previously identified audience segments on climate change to one of three experimental conditions. Subjects were asked to read uniquely framed news articles about climate change emphasizing either the risks to the environment, public health, or national security and the benefits of mitigation and adaptation-related actions. Results show that across audience segments, the public health focus was the most likely to elicit emotional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Findings also indicated that the national security frame may possibly boomerang among audience segments already doubtful or dismissive of the issue, eliciting unintended feelings of anger.},
